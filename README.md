# Malware Unpacking and Process Injection identification

Welcome to a little write-up I am working on that provides some theory and some examples on executable packing and process injection.
In this write up you will learn the following:
- Why packers are used
- What is a packers stub
- How packers resolve imports
- How to identify packed programs
- Example run throughs:
  - Automatic unpacking
  - Manual unpacking
  - Process Injection
All related executable files can be found [samples zip file](https://github.com/potato4974/Malware-Unpacking-and-Identifying-Process-Injection/blob/main/Unpacking_ProcessInjection_samples.7z), password to unzip is: infectedinfected
Main write-up can also be found [here](https://github.com/potato4974/Malware-Unpacking-and-Identifying-Process-Injection/blob/main/Manual_unpacking_san.md)<br>
